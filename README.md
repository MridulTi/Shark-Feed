## Our Story
As we know, Aspiring entrepreneurs lack a platform specifically designed to showcase their diverse startup ideas to a broad audience of potential
investors, mentors, and collaborators.

And they face countless problems such as :
1. TRADITIONAL METHODS are LIMITED, EXPENSIVE and  EXCLUSIVE
2. SOCIAL MEDIA is SCATTERED, UNTARGETED
3. EXISTING PLATFORMS are not NICHE
4. THE NEED FOR VIRTUAL STARTUP PITCHING HAS BECOME PARAMOUNT (POST-PANDEMIC)

To counter this we came up with the idea of SharkFeed, which is a Niched Platform that
## Gives you a place for 
### OPEN PITCHING
   > Startups of all backgrounds and industries can  detailed pitches outlining their innovative ideas, business models, and progress
## 
### TARGETED INVESTMENTS 
> Investors and mentors can easily discover promising startups based on their interests and investment criteria
# 
### STARTUP ECOSYSTEM
>A diverse community of entrepreneurs, investors, and collaborators can
connect, network, and foster valuable partnerships
